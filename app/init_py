This file is the __init__.py for the 'app' package. It is used to initialize the package and can include 
package-level variables, imports, and setup code
# However, be cautious with imports here to avoid circular dependencies.
# 
You can also add package-level docstrings or metadata if needed.
# __version__ = "1.0.0"
# __author__ = "Your Name"
# __all__ = ["services", "utils", "models"]
# 
This file can also be used to set up logging or configuration settings for the package.
# For example:
# import logging
# logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
# Overall, this file serves as the entry point
 for the 'app' package and helps organize 
 the code structure.
